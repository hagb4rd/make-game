- make package.json private
- maybe generate the manifest.json dynamically and add it to .gitignore?

port all the changes from jklm
- room -> gameRoom
- roomData -> gameRoom directement
- pouvoir être déco sans être retiré du jeu (timeout) !
- pub state merging with updatePubData()
- content system with categories, reviews, etc.
- keep lobby player IDs fully private? and just have in-game-room IDs. or just have lobby player secrets and incremental lobby player ids, seems simpler!
- when window is small, make side hover instead of resize the main pane
